# magic_mirror

Magic Mirror is a smart mirror that is voice controlled. This is possible as it is powered by RaspberryPi
 which is able to process faces for authentication using a camera, process voice commands through a microphone and senses your presence using an IR sensor enabling it to switch off when the user is not around to save power!
